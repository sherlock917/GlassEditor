###Instruction###

 1. On the page of Glass Editor, you can see a large area on the left and a small one on the right.
 2. The large one is the preview area, you can see the preview of the card you are editing there.And now, i am happy to announce that you can edit in-place right in the preview area. Just double click the preview area to write your own stuff or apply a template then change the content of the template.
 3. The small one is the editing area, you can type your HTML in the textarea or insert elements simply by clicking the buttons on the top. We have "section" "div" "p" "table" "tr" "td" "ul" "li" "figure" "img" "em" and "strong" there, which are all basic elements for a UI of google glass.
 4. For styles, we have three types of class names you can pick from. Move your cursor to a proper place (in the middle of the quotation marks) then click a type you want, such as color, then select a property, the class name will be added automatically. And if you're editing in the preview area, the class-name and the style will be applyed to the text you select in the preview area.
 5. If you don't know how to design a card, you can click the "Template" button to see some templates and then edit them the way you want.
 6. You can also edit a bundle of cards here, just click the "Multi" button to switch to the bundle mode, or click the "Single" button to switch back.
 7. Don't like what you've done? Click the clear button to cast the Obliviate charm!
